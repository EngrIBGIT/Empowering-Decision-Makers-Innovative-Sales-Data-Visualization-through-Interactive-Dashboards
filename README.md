## Business Overview/Problem 
CLEARX Cosmetics faces a significant business challenge in effectively monitoring and optimizing its sales performance across its branches. 
- The key obstacles the company encounters include: 
A. Data Fragmentation: Sales data is collected manually across the two branches, leading to fragmented, error-prone records. 
B. Limited Data Analysis: The lack of data analysis tools hinders the company's ability to gain insights into product performance, customer preferences, and regional trends. 
C. Resource Allocation: CLEARX Cosmetics struggles to allocate resources efficiently, leading to stockouts or overstock situations.

##  Rationale for the Project 
A. Data Centralization: Establish a centralized data repository for sales information from the two branches to eliminate fragmentation and enhance data consistency 
B. Basic Data Insights: Enable the company to obtain fundamental data insights, including sales trends, product performance, and customer preferences 
C. Cost-Efficiency: Provide a cost-efficient solution that aligns with the company's budget constraints while delivering essential data analysis capabilities. 
D. Streamlined Resource Allocation: Improve resource allocation by leveraging data-driven decisions to minimize stock outs and overstock situations. 

## Aim of the Project 
The project aims to achieve the following specific objectives: 
A. Develop a centralized data repository for sales data from all three branches, ensuring data consistency and accuracy. 
B. Implement basic data analysis techniques to gain insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer preferences. 
C. Create user-friendly dashboards for easy access to sales data and insights. 
D. Carry out basic data analysis, and dashboard utilization to enhance decision-making capabilities.
